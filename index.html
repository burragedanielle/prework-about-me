      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Web Developer (to be) based out of KCMO.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Denver, Colorado where I was raised and spent over 15 years of my life. I moved to Missouri in 2012 to go to MU, and now I call KC my home! Currently, I live in Overland Park, Kansas.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a writer and an artist...even if what I create is really crappy - it's fun! I like reading books (currently reading F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Beautiful and Damned"), video games, scrolling around Wikipedia to learn new things, and staying caught up on my favorite TV shows and cartoons.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is UX / UI for eCommerce.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Overland Park, KS.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because of one word: possibility. When you're a dev, the ball is in your court, the keys are in your hands. If you can dream it, it can be created; and the fun part is the challenge of figuring out how.</p>
